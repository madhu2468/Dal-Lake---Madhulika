                Dal is mentioned as Mahasarit (Sanskrit-महासरित्) in ancient Sanskrit texts. Ancient history records mention that a village named
                Isabar to the east of Dal was the residence of goddess Durga. This place was known as Sureshwari on the bank of 
                the lake, which was sourced by a spring called the Satadhara.

                During the Mughal period, the Mughal rulers of India designated Kashmir, Srinagar in particular, as their summer resort.
                They developed the precincts of the Dal in Srinagar with sprawling Mughal-type gardens and pavilions as pleasure resorts to 
                enjoy the salubrious cool climate.After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, which led to the disintegration of the Mughal Empire,
                Pashtun tribes in the area around the lake and city increased, and the Afghan Durrani Empire ruled the city for several decades.
                In 1814 a significant part of the Kashmir valley, including Srinagar, was annexed from the Afghans by Raja Ranjit Singh to his kingdom,
                and the Sikhs grew in influence in the region for 27 years.

                During the Dogra Raj, Srinagar became the capital of Dogra territory, attracted by the cool climate of the Kashmir valley, 
                amidst the back drop of the majestic snow covered Himalayan ranges. The lake precincts experience temperatures in the range 
                of 1–11 °C (34–52 °F) during winter and 12–30 °C (54–86 °F) during the summer season. The lake freezes when temperatures drop to 
                about −11 °C (12 °F) during severe winter. Although the Dogra Maharaja of Kashmir restricted the building of houses in the valley,
                 the British circumvented this rule by commissioning lavish houseboats to be built on the Dal. The houseboats have been referred to as,
                 "each one a little piece of England afloat on Dal."

                 After the independence of India, the Kashmiri Hanji people have built, owned and maintained these houseboats, cultivating
                  floating gardens and producing commodities for the market, making them the centre of their livelihoods. The houseboats,
                   closely associated with Dal also provide accommodation in Srinagar. Following the Mughal, Afghan, Sikh and Dogra rule, 
                   the place has earned the epithet, "Jewel in the crown of Kashmir"
