                The lake is popular as a visitor attraction and a summer resort. 
                Fisheries and the harvesting of food and fodder plants are also important on Dal.
                 Weeds from the lake are extracted and converted into compost for the gardens.It also serves as a
                  flood lung of the Jhelum River. Swimming, boating, snow skiing (particularly when the lake is frozen
                   during the severe winter), and canoeing are amongst some of the water sports activities practised on the lake.
